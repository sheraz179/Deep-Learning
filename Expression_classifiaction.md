# Deep-Learning
This file deals with the classification of 7 face expressions of surprise, neutral, fear, disgust, happiness, sadness and anger. The dataset being used belongs
to the Real-world Affective Faces (RAF) Database. Different machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques were applied in order to achieve the higher accuracy. For the 
machine learning, different combination of image features and algorithms are employed. From the obtained results, it can be established that deep learning tends to work better.
